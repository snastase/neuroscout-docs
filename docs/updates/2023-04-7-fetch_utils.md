One of the primary goals of Neuroscout is to make it easy to create and share fully reproducible fMRI analyses using a fully web based interface. However, there is always a tradeoff between *ease of use and flexibility*. To make Neuroscout easy to use, we have to make assumptions about the types of analyses that users want to perform. We ensure the reproducibility of analyses by only allowing users to perform analyses that are fully specified in the BIDS Stats Model specification, and are executable by [FitLins](https://fitlins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (a BIDS App that implements the [BIDS Stats Model specification](https://bids-standard.github.io/stats-models/)). As of now, this means that users can only perform multi-level GLM analyses, and can only use predictors that are indexed by Neuroscout.

As such, there are many analyses that are not possible to perform using the web-based Neuroscout interface. This can be a challenge for naturalistic data in particular, as this area of research is rapid evolving and new analyses are constantly being developed. Although we have plans to continously expand the types of analyses that can be performed on Neuroscout (and in turn BIDS Stats Model and FitLins), there will always be analyses that are not possible to perform in a centralized fashion using a web interface.

## New utilities for fetching Neuroscout data üõ†Ô∏è

To address this, we have released a new set of API utilities (`pyns.fetch_utils`) that allow users to easily fetch data from the Neuroscout API for custom analysis. This new addition allows users to fetch both predictors and brain imaging time courses from Neuroscout using a simple, uniform API. 

As a reminder, Neuroscout indexes over a dozen openly available neuroimaging datasets (browse here: https://neuroscout.org/datasets), and for each dataset we extract hundreds of predictors (browse here: https://neuroscout.org/predictors). All of these predictors are centrally indexed by Neuroscout, and made publically available using a uniform API, which can be access using the [pyNS](https://pyns.readthedocs.io/en/latest) Python client.

The new `pyns.fetch_utils` allow users to easily fetch predictors and brain imaging time courses from any of these datasets. `fetch_predictors` allows users to fetch several predictors from any of the indexed datasets simultaneously using a simple API, and optionally apply transformations using the `pybids.modeling` tools (like you would in BIDS Stats Models). For example, you can easily resample the predictors to TR (which may be sampled at different rates), rescale them, and densify them (may be sparse) into an aligned timecourse. 

`fetch_images` allows users to downloading preprocessed brain imaging time courses from any of the indexed datasets (with the help of [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) that align with the predictors.

With a set of predictors, and a set of brain imaging time courses, users can then easily fit any custom analysis they want using their favorite machine learning library, such as scikit-learn. 

To learn more about `pyns.fetch_utils`, check out the [documentation](https://pyns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fetching.html).

## An encoding model tutorial! üöÄ

To demonstrate how to use `pyns.fetch_utils`, we have created a new example notebook that demonstrates how to fit a simple voxelwise encoding model using the new API fetch utilities. 

In this example, we implement a cross-validated voxelwise encoding model for a single subject using ridge regression implemented in [Himalaya](https://github.com/gallantlab/himalaya). This example was based on the fantastic [voxelwise modeling tutorials](https://gallantlab.org/voxelwise_tutorials/) by the Gallant Lab , so be sure to check out their tutorials if you are interested in learning more about voxelwise encoding models for fMRI data. 

Check out the [example in the Neuroscout Docs](https://neuroscout.github.io/neuroscout-docs/python_api/ridge_encoding.html), and follow along in the cloud using Google Colab by clicking on the üöÄ.

## Where to go from here? 

We hope `pyns.fetch_utils` will help you create your own custom workflows using the Neuroscout platform.

However, be aware we are actively working on expanding the types of analyses that can be performed on Neuroscout, with a focus on adding support for voxelwise encoding models in BIDS Stats Models and [Neuroscout-CLI](https://neuroscout-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Also, note that by implementing a custom pipeline, your analysis will not be centrally registered on neuroscout.org, and a reproducible record will not be made. For analyses supported the [Neuroscout-CLI](https://neuroscout-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), it is recommended to use the neuroscout.org web inteface, or follow the guide for programmatically creating analyses using [pyNS](https://pyns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/analyses.html).

Finally, if you develop a workflow using `pyns.fetch_utils`, we would love to hear about it, so we can help you share it with the community!

Be sure to stay tuned for more updates, and get in touch if you want to contribute!
